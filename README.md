# 32-Well + Thermogenetics Box

This behavioral apparatus adapts the 32-well behavior chambers used for Drosophila copulation duration and courtship assays to be compatible with thermogenetic manipulations.
This set-up utilizes a water reservoir that sits below the floor of the behavior chambers, allowing the experimenter to control the temperature within in the well by manipulating the source of the water.
The reservior is connected to a water bath that can be set to warmer temperatures, from which water is continuously pumped in a closed loop from the bath to the reservior and back to the bath.

The 32-WellThermogeneticsBox_BehaviorChambers files contain schematics and laser cutter settings for producing the 32-well plate with water reservior.
